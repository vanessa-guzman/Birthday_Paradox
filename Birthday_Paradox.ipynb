    "# Birthday Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability, the birthday paradox is the unexpected answer to the question *\"How many people would need to be in a room for there to be a 50% chance that at least two of them share the same birthday?\"* We might think that there would need to be a large number of people, given that there are 365 days in a year, but according to the birthday paradox only **23** people are needed for the probability of two people sharing a birthday to reach 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore this phenomenon by examining the birthdays of NBA players. First I use Selenium to webscrape and Pandas to clean the players' information. Then, I use excel to examine repeated birthdays by team, division, and conference to explore how the number of repeated birthdays changes as our group grows in size."
